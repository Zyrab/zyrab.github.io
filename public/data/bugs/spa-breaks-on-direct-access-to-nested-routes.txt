# SPA Breaks on Direct Access to Nested Routes

While deploying my custom SPA on Vercel, I noticed that navigating via client-side routing worked fine,  but directly accessing nested routes (e.g., [[/dashboard/settings]]) caused a crash with this error:

```pgsql
Failed to load module script: 
Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html"
```

## Root Cause

I had referenced assets like this in `index.html`:

```html
<script type="module" src="app.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

Without a leading `/`, the browser treats these as relative to the current URL path. So at [[/dashboard/settings]], it tries to load:

`/dashboard/settings/app.js`
`/dashboard/settings/style.css`

These paths donâ€™t exist, so Vercel returns `index.html` (due to SPA rewrites), which leads to the browser trying to interpret {{HTML::gold}} as [[JS/CSS]].  Causing {{MIME type errors::red}}.

## Fix

Change asset paths to be root-relative:

```html
<script type="module" src="/app.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css">
```

This ensures assets are loaded from the root regardless of the current route.
